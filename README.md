# Binary-Tree-Simulation

This is the simulation of the binary tree completely implemented in java using ACM library.
To run this file you should import the ACM library to your java program.<br>
The steps to import ACM file are -><br>
  1) Download the acm.jar file which is there in this repository.<br>
  2) Copy (or import) them into your Eclipse project. People often put external JARs into a lib directory, but that's just
     personal choice.<br>
  3) Add them to the project's build path.<br>
Run the java file using eclipse or you can use any other IDE.<br>

In this application we can insert, delete and search the integer in the binany tree. The inorder, preorder and postorder of the tree is continuously displayed in labels.<br>
There is another file ThreadTree.java which simulates threaded binary tree. The thread is shown as the red colored line.
This application also has the same features as that of the BinaryTree.java. 
The search will show a blue colored circle on the node of the tree where the given integer is  present
